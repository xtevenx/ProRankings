Things to manually update
-------------------------

* `main.py`: Start and end dates for line plot.
* `main.py`: Line plot selected teams.
* `pro_rankings.py`: Pro league names for API access.
* `pro_rankings.py`: Season end dates (except they're actually start dates).
* `TEMPLATE.html`: Pro league wiki links.

*Note: These are also possible targets for automation.*
