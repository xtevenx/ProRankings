Displayed here is the calculated rating data of professional League of Legends 
teams. The ratings are calculated using the [glicko-2][1] rating system.

Ratings of Teams
----------------

This chart lists the calculated ratings for the top teams in the four major
leagues (LCS, LEC, LCK, LPL).

Note: the top teams from minor leagues may have their ratings inflated if they 
dominated their league. This is because if there are no inter-region games, 
one's rating is solely based on their performance within their region.
