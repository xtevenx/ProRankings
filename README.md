Displayed here is the calculated rating data of professional League of Legends 
teams. The ratings are calculated using the [glicko-2][1] rating system.

Ratings of Teams
----------------

This chart lists the calculated ratings for the teams attending Worlds 2020. 

Note: the top teams from minor leagues may have their ratings inflated if they 
dominated their league. This is because if there are no inter-region games, 
one's rating is solely based on their dominance within their region.

Rating Progression of Select Teams
----------------------------------

This chart depicts the calculated rating progression for select teams. The 
are selected based on my personal opinions on who is a strong/promising team.
